# DBGUI

Hello and welcome to DBGUI! DBGUI is a personal project I've started to broaden my knowledge of the following technologies:

* Python
* React
* Postgres
* Docker

DBGUI is a simple web interface for interacting with a database through. Or rather, it will be. As of 2/20/2021, the plan is to use docker to launch 3 containers, a React container which will hold our client facing code. The Postgres container, where the database is housed. And finally, a Python container which will work as an API between the Postgres and React containers. Very simple, for the moment.

Planned functionality:

* Define new databases and schemas. 
* Populate tables with data.
* View columns in database using an advanced search.

Down the road:

* Define relationships between tables
* Define more advanced procedures for interaction, such as populating multiple tables in a single step.
